Yelp Dataset
=====

Just out of curiosity  I was thinking of getting google map image of business using its lat long given in dataset. I am stuck in fetching the image using GoogleMaps Image API. My idea is to take those images and see what  features does CNN can give us. Once I have that I can further evaluate sentiments of reviews and using business attributes and features given by CNN I will try to predict review sentiments(which is a number between 0 and 1)

Rationale behind it is that people might base their reviews based on surroundings which I dont completely agree with.

I also found that negative reviews were voted 'useful' most of the times as compared to positive... reflecting the nature of selfish human beings (I dont use Yelp a lot.. :P)

and I saw Hooters has highest number of reviews :: majority positive :smile:
